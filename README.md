# Design Patterns in Python

Just refreshing some design patterns and learning some python on the way.

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

* [Observer Pattern](./observer-pattern/README.md): lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
* [Strategy Pattern](./strategy-pattern/README.md): lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
* [Iterator Pattern](./iterator-pattern/README.md): lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

## Structural Patterns

Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

* [Decorator Pattern](./decorator-pattern/README.md): lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
* [Composite Pattern](./composite-pattern/README.md): lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
