# Design Patterns in Python

Just refreshing some design patterns and learning some python on the way.

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

* [Observer Pattern](./observer-pattern/README.md)
* [Strategy Pattern](./strategy-pattern/README.md)

## Structural Patterns

Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

* [Decorator Pattern](./decorator-pattern/README.md)
* [Composite Pattern](./composite-pattern/README.md)
